Learn More History of Central Florida Animal Reserve Central Florida Animal Reserve (CFAR) has been a dedicated steward of big cats since its humble beginnings in 1996. From its roots in Palm Bay, to decades in Brevard County, and now its home in beautiful East Osceola County, CFAR’s mission has always centered around the care and conservation of lions, tigers, leopards, and cougars.In its early years, CFAR was deeply involved in the larger narrative of big cats in entertainment, institutional roles, and species propagation. At the time, the threat of extinction loomed large, particularly for tigers, with predictions that they would disappear from the wild by the early 21st century. In response, CFAR committed to preservation efforts, including breeding programs that sought to ensure the survival of these magnificent animals.However, in 2007, CFAR shifted its focus. The organization reincorporated, ended its breeding initiatives, and began concentrating solely on providing a sanctuary for its resident big cats. Around this time, the search for a permanent home began. In 2010, a suitable location was found, but it took until 2013 to secure the necessary agreements and complete environmental surveys. With a remarkable effort fueled entirely by volunteers and without paid staff, CFAR launched a four-year fundraising campaign, raising $1.3 million to construct a new facility.In 2017, CFAR made its historic move, relocating 25 big cats nearly 60 miles to their new home in Osceola County. Since then, the organization has rehomed 15 more cats and continues to provide a vital platform for individuals passionate about entering the challenging world of big cat care.Today, CFAR’s primary program focuses on advancing the art and science of big cat husbandry, always keeping the animals’ unique needs at the forefront. In addition, CFAR works to create meaningful connections between people and the wild, harnessing the power of the natural environment to inspire and educate. Our Mission “To create a platform to address the challenge of big cats for the future, and provide value to society today.” Through the dedication of its volunteers and the generosity of its supporters, CFAR continues to shape a brighter future for big cats while enriching the lives of those who support and engage with this important work.",

One of the most significant initiatives shaping that future is the 3 V’s Campaign, a focused effort to strengthen the reserve through infrastructure, sustainability, and advanced medical care.The 3 V’s represent three interconnected priorities that address the evolving needs of big cats and the people who care for them: Visitor Center, Viability, and Veterinary Hospital. The 3 V’s Campaign WHAT WE AIM TO ADDRESS​ CFAR works to address ongoing challenges facing big cats through education, responsible care, and community involvement. A core component of this effort is the support and engagement of volunteers who help drive daily operations and mission-based programming.Ongoing challenges include staffing needs for facilitating tours, supporting animal care operations, and maintaining consistent engagement with members and visitors. Visitor Center Sharing the world of big cats begins with the right environment. CFAR’s vision for a dedicated Visitor and Education Center is rooted in the belief that meaningful education requires space that invites learning, reflection, and connection.Since opening for scheduled visitation in November 2017, CFAR has welcomed thousands of guests. A purpose-built visitor center will allow the reserve to better engage the community, tell the CFAR story, and highlight the challenges facing big cats today. Present Needs Indoor, climate-controlled space for guests Restroom access for visitors Space to host presentations, fundraising events, and educational programs Interactive displays designed to engage diverse audiences A dedicated area for merchandise display and educational materials Future ImpactThe envisioned visitor center will feature interactive exhibits and mixed-use multimedia designed to deepen understanding and enhance the overall experience at CFAR. The space will also support expanded educational programming, community events, and fundraising initiatives By increasing CFAR’s ability to host and educate visitors, the visitor center becomes a direct investment in long-term sustainability and public awareness.

Join the Cause | Leave a Legacy Help build a strong foundation that supports big cat care today and for generations to come. Support the Viability initiative. donate Veterinary Hospital Long-term care requires advanced medical capabilities. CFAR’s vision includes the development of a dedicated veterinary hospital designed specifically to meet the complex needs of big cat residents.An on-site veterinary hospital would centralize care, reduce stress on residents, and allow for timely, comprehensive medical treatment. today Procedures requiring anesthesia are performed within enclosures Veterinary activity may increase stress for nearby residents Equipment must be transported into enclosures, sometimes over long distances Specialty equipment must be scheduled in advance Examinations may require multiple personnel due to size and weight Treatments are limited to daylight hours future Procedures performed in controlled, indoor environments Reduced stress through isolated veterinary activity Permanently installed equipment ",
